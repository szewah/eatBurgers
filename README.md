## Eat-Da-Burger! 

A basic full stack restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Once entered, the available burger sits on the left hand side of the screen with a corresponding devour button. The user presses the devour button and the chosen burger moves to the right hand side of the screen.
